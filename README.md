<h1>Snort Installation on Kali Linux</h1>

<p>This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to install Snort, an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system, on Kali Linux. Follow the steps below to set up Snort on your Kali Linux system.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Edit Package Sources</h2>

<p>Open the terminal and use a text editor to edit the package sources list. In this example, we'll use Mousepad:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>In the opened file, add the following line to include the necessary Debian repository:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ bullseye non-free contrib main
</code></pre>

<p>Save the changes by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and exit the editor with <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Update Package Lists</h2>

<p>After modifying the sources list, update the package lists to reflect the changes:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 3: Install Snort</h2>

<p>Finally, install Snort using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install snort
</code></pre>

<p>This command will download and install Snort along with its dependencies.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that your system is connected to the internet during the installation process to fetch the required packages.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Snort on your Kali Linux system. You can now proceed with configuring Snort for your specific needs and start utilizing its intrusion detection capabilities. Feel free to customize the Snort configuration based on your network requirements.</p>
