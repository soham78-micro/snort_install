This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to install Snort, an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system, on Kali Linux. Follow the steps below to set up Snort on your Kali Linux system.

## Step 1: Edit Package Sources

Open the terminal and use a text editor to edit the package sources list. In this example, we'll use Mousepad:

sudo mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list
```

In the opened file, add the following line to include the necessary Debian repository:

```bash
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ bullseye non-free contrib main
```

Save the changes by pressing `Ctrl+S` and exit the editor with `Ctrl+X`.

## Step 2: Update Package Lists

After modifying the sources list, update the package lists to reflect the changes:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

## Step 3: Install Snort

Finally, install Snort using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install snort

This command will download and install Snort along with its dependencies.

**Note:** Ensure that your system is connected to the internet during the installation process to fetch the required packages.
